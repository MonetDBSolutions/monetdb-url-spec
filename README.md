MonetDB URL Specification
=========================

This repository contains the proposed specification for the new `monetdb://` /
`monetdbs://` style MonetDB URLs as opposed to the `mapi:monetdb://` URLs we
use right now.

Status: proposal only.

The main spec is in [monetdb-url.md][spec]. It tries to be short and to the
point. Everything that does not fit there is in [monetdb-url-faq.md][faq].
Finally, directory [tests](tests) contains some test cases that can be used to
test client implementations.
